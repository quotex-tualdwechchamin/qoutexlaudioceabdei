# Quotex Volume Oscillator: A Comprehensive Guide

## Understanding Volume Oscillator

A volume oscillator is a technical indicator that measures the
relationship between two moving averages of volume. It helps determine
the strength and momentum of a trend by comparing current volume levels
to historical averages.

## Interpreting the Oscillator

The volume oscillator fluctuates above and below a zero line:

-   Positive values indicate sufficient market support to continue the
    current price trend.
-   Negative values suggest a lack of support, potentially leading to
    stagnant or reversed prices.

## Using the Oscillator for Trading

The oscillator can provide valuable insights when combined with other
technical indicators:

-   **Rising Volume Oscillator with Rising Prices:** Confirms the
    uptrend\'s strength.
-   **Falling Volume Oscillator with Falling Prices:** Indicates a
    potential trend reversal.
-   **Increasing Volume with Declining Prices:** Bearish signal,
    suggesting the trend may weaken or reverse.
